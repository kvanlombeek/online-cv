career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I like to call myself a full stack data-scientist, as I am interested in 
      every aspect of modern data-science. From cleaning small .csv files to large Postgress databases,
      from training a linear model to a deep neural net, from a Matplotlib visualisation to a 
      responsive web application.

experiences:
    - role: Service engineer
      time: 2011 - 2013
      company: Elliot Turbo
      details: |
        After my graduation as energy engineer, I wanted to travel. So I joined Elliot Turbo
        as service engineer. I traveled in the US, Europe and the Middle-East to repair 
        and overhaul 80MW compressors.
    - role: Wind turbine maintenance engineer
      time: 2013 - 2015
      company: Belwind
      details: |
        After experiencing the oil and gas industry, I wanted to work on renewables. 
        As maintenance engineer, I spend quite a lot of time on the Belgian offshore 
        wind turbines. I dived into the (financial) reporting to the management and shareholders. 
        I became an Excel guru and played with numbers every day. I realized I lacked some knowledge
        and took a year off to study statistics.
    - role: Data scientist
      time: 2016 - 2017
      company: KBC data lab
      details: |
        After studying statistics, I joined the big-data lab of a large Belgian bank (KBC). It was a
        perfect hands-on environment to master all the techniques I learned in the master of
        statistics. Surrounded by phd levels, I learned about more or less every single data related
        technology.
    - role: Founder - Data scientist
      time: 2017 - 2019
      company: Rockestate
      details: |
        I made my master thesis in statistics about enriching house listings with open data to 
        predict the price of each house in Belgium. I continued to work on it during the weekends, 
        and in 2017 I convinced two associates to start up the company Rockestate. Multiple banks and 
        insurers now use the Rockestate curated data-lake and products. I left the company because after
        four years it is was time for something new.

        My CV might look a bit all over the place. I prefer talking about the projects I worked on in the past. 
    assignments:
      - title: Rockestate - Zimmo Prijswijzer
        link: "www.zimmo.be/nl/prijswijzer"
        tagline: "Zimmo, a belgian online real estate platform, asked Rockestate to build an online tool to help
                  users predict the price of their house. We have build the entire backend. The statistical model
                  is based upon a geo-spatial regression technique, called Geographically Weighted Regression. 
                  I originally developed this model during my master thesis"

      - title: Names I Like
        link: "www.namesilike.com"
        tagline: "A couple of years ago, all of my friends started to have kids (I have two kids of my own by
                now). I thought I could help my girlfriend predicting which name they were going to pick. 
                This hobby project turned into a website with over 100k visitors per year. The backend is 
                based on a recommender algorithm based upon matrix factorization, made famous by the Netflix
                competition."
